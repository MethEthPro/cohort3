the jwts can be decoded by anyone 

but they can be verified by only the server that issued them,
so it is not a problem

just like you can sign a cheque and show it to everyone but it will 
only go through once you have been verified as the passbook holder

we then make a middleware that takes the token and check if the user exists

if it does then it sends us forward and also gives the user in the request for future user
otherwise we stop 

we make a frontend and to ensure that there are no CORS error , we load the html file on http://localhost:3000 itself

it has a signup/signin section , so we implement that functionality and with the help of axios calls
we make contact with our backend , and we store the reponse recieved from the backend

if we have signed in a user , we need to store the users token in the localstorage of the session , it should stay there
till the time user log outs , and if the user log outs the token gets deleted

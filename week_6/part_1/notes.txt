suppose we were to signin in facebook , then we would give our email id and pass to the site
and in return we would get a token , this token will make sure that for all 
the further request like GET all post, POST a mew post , the site remembers us

it gives us persistent sessions , we login once and it works forever
we get this token everytime we sign in



now that we have implemented a manual token
we see that everytime we have a me request or another request where we have to check
if the user exists we have to go to our databse ,in this the in memory users list , to verify
existance of user with the help of the token provided, this is an expensive operation


so this type of token that we implemented are called stateful tokens
By stateful here, we mean that we need to store these tokens in a variable right now (and eventually in a database). 

The problem is that we need to send a request to the database every time the user wants to hit an authenticated endpoint

the solution is JWTs

JSON web Tokens

JWTs, or JSON Web Tokens, are a compact and self-contained way to represent information between two parties.
They are commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web applications.

JWTs are Stateless: JWTs contain all the information needed to authenticate a request, so the server doesnâ€™t need to store session data.
All the data is stored in the token itself.

how is this jwt formed?

basically it is an encoding of the email,name

so when a user send the jwt in the header , it can be decoded in the server only and user existence can be checked, without ever gping to our database
